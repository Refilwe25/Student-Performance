# Student Performance Analysis

### Project Overview
The goal for this data analysis is to outline the performance of students from a secondary school and provide insights on what can be improved. By analysizing various aspects of this student performance data, I seek to identify best performing areas, performance trends and gain more understanding on how overall performance of students came about. 

### Data Sources
Student Performance data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Student_Academic_Performance.csv." file that contains information about the student's performance.

### Tools
- Excel - Data cleaning and analysis
- SQL Server - Data analysis and trend identification
- Power BI - Visualization and creation of report

### Data preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following the tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Removed duplicates
- Formatted data and inconsistent values
- Added "Average of student" column 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This analysis aims to answer keys questions such as:
1. What is the overall performance of all grades?
2. What is the total average of each grade?
3. What is the average of each subject?
4. Which grade and subject is the best performing?
5. How many students failed/passed certain modules?

### Data analysis


### Results
The results for this analysis is summarized as follows:
The overall performance of all grades was impressively high, along with the average performance of each grades. English and science were the best performing subjects and had the most number of distinctions (80%). Improvements should be made in grade 11 and 9 as they had an average below 70% and focus more science and math subjects respectfully.

### Recommendations
Based on my analysis, I recommend the following:
1. Implement robust technological intergration in classes and incorporate AI to particularly improve the performance of average performers.
1. Allocate more time-period specifically on the subject of mathematics since it had the lowest average performance.
2. Have workshops that educate students on how to identify their studying methods ncourage creative-thinking for students 
3.
